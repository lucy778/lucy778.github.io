      <description>What is Peripera Ink Airy Velvet Lip Tint? It&amp;rsquo;s basically a moussey lipstick which stains your lips. You can wear it like a liquid lipstick or remove it and just leave the tint.
How does it look? See the pics :)
Shade: #3 Sold Out Red. This is a cool red with a matte appearance. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t emphasise lip lines, it is super smoothing.
How does it wear? The Tint is long lasting but the liquid lipstick is not and has a tendency to smear and transfer.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Lucy and I have started this blog because basically, I spend a lot of time and money on make up and I want to channel my obssession into something more productive than just browsing instagram, youtube and reddit.
I want to share my thoughts on my favourite and not so favourite make up and beauty trends.
I know I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the blogging hype train by oh, about 10 years or so, but this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve never personally done and I thought it would be fun.</description>
