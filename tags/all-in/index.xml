      <description>Some months ago now, I talked about Stephanie Buttermore’s “all in” dieting approach. Basically, she recognised that she had very disordered eating and hunger signals. This was having a knock on effect on her overall health, especially her hormone levels.
She decided to follow a diet where she would eat at least 2500 calories a day, with no upper limit to get her hunger, weight, and health back to normal levels.</description>
