      <description>Who is Hindash? This is the nom de guerre of Mohammed Hindash, a makeup artist based in Dubai, Arab Emirates. I don‚Äôt know much about him to be honest, but I know that his makeup is red hot fire, his voice is calming, and his tutorials are crisp, clean and well narrated. His dog is also adorable. üê∂
His makeup style is very neutral and minimal. His makeup is definitely Arab-inspired, as he loves to play up the eyes with wings and inner corner cat eyeliner, however it is much more pared back than classic Arab makeup.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a lot luckier than some people when it comes to home gym equipment. I have some adjustable dumbbells already, and even the resistance bands I preordered online have arrived. But despite this, my workout routine has collapsed.
For me, gym wasn&amp;rsquo;t about doing something. It was about going somewhere. Just the act of going there makes the rest so much easier. You&amp;rsquo;re there, at the gym, to lift weights.</description>
