      <description>I have never purchased a Morphe product before this palette because I always found the shade duplication off putting. It looks like they are moving away from that type of palette, since they are discontinuing a bunch of the palettes which are basically 35 shades of brown.
I have also never bought a Pony collaboration because none of them have really been that interesting.
The concept for this Icy Fantasy Palette is awesome though.</description>
