      <description>If you have scalp itchiness then one of the common causes is psoriasis. This means you get dry, scaly patches on your scalp.
There are other causes of scalp dryness and itchiness like seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. I’m going to focus on psoriasis because this is what I have and what I know about.
But the advice for moisturizing scalp applies for anyone with dry scalp. General scalp dryness and itchiness and advice is discussed below – click HERE to skip ahead.</description>

      <description>I’m researching iron at the moment because I have iron deficiency problems. Sources used will be linked as they come up.
Here is the lowdown on iron in a Q&amp;amp;A format:
How much iron do you have in your body? Healthy people have 4-5 grams of iron in their body The amount is approx. 38 mg iron/kg body weight for women and 50 mg iron/kg body for men.
Where is iron used in your body?</description>

      <title>Why keto diets are garbage</title>

      <description>Recently, I have done some experimenting with keto baking. To say that I am bitterly disappointed is an understatement.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also done some Coursera courses on nutrition and exercise science. This has crystallised my thoughts into the following:
&amp;ldquo;Keto is an overhyped, money-making sham.&amp;rdquo;
Let me defend this opinion.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what keto is good for. Obviously, it is good for epileptics, as this is what it was originally designed for.</description>

      <description>Some months ago now, I talked about Stephanie Buttermore’s “all in” dieting approach. Basically, she recognised that she had very disordered eating and hunger signals. This was having a knock on effect on her overall health, especially her hormone levels.
She decided to follow a diet where she would eat at least 2500 calories a day, with no upper limit to get her hunger, weight, and health back to normal levels.</description>

      <description>I found about Ashley because of her side hustle(main hustle?) as a fitness model, not so much because of her IFBB bikini pro bodybuilding and Olympia accolades. Since I watch allll the glute workout videos, I watched her glute videos, and I thought she had an awesome attitude. She is so bubbly and motivated and fun. Her coach, Adam Bonilla, is super smart, sensible, and low stress.
They started this “Bikini and the Brain” podcast together towards the end of last year where they talk about their experiences with pro bikini bodybuilding competitions and address common questions and misconceptions.</description>

      <description>I am not gonna put any qualifiers or disclaimers here. Bad advice is bad advice, even if there is far worse out there.
I am also not going to do a deep dive and watch 50 videos from this guy to give some thorough, comprehensive review. I have seen enough.
I watched his “Is Workout Volume Actually Killing Your Gains? (Athlean-X Response)” video which came up in my youtube recommendations, probably because I am a fan of Athlean-X.</description>
