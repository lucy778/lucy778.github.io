      <description>I’m researching iron at the moment because I have iron deficiency problems. Sources used will be linked as they come up.
Here is the lowdown on iron in a Q&amp;amp;A format:
How much iron do you have in your body? Healthy people have 4-5 grams of iron in their body The amount is approx. 38 mg iron/kg body weight for women and 50 mg iron/kg body for men.
Where is iron used in your body?</description>

      <description>Recently, I have done some experimenting with keto baking. To say that I am bitterly disappointed is an understatement.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also done some Coursera courses on nutrition and exercise science. This has crystallised my thoughts into the following:
&amp;ldquo;Keto is an overhyped, money-making sham.&amp;rdquo;
Let me defend this opinion.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what keto is good for. Obviously, it is good for epileptics, as this is what it was originally designed for.</description>

      <description>Some months ago now, I talked about Stephanie Buttermore’s “all in” dieting approach. Basically, she recognised that she had very disordered eating and hunger signals. This was having a knock on effect on her overall health, especially her hormone levels.
She decided to follow a diet where she would eat at least 2500 calories a day, with no upper limit to get her hunger, weight, and health back to normal levels.</description>
