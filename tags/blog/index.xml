      <description>These are both super skinny retractable pencil liners. The Clio one is a bit skinnier than the Dose of Colors one but they are both tiny. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with the use case of these things. You&amp;rsquo;re on the way to work or some important date or social event, and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to apply liner at home before you left. Because sleep is important, dammit.
For this use case, this type of liner is perfect.</description>

      <description>There is a very cool post on Reddit which talks about how you can measure the dimensions of eyelash curlers and your eye to ensure they match up. It&amp;rsquo;s based on this nerdy and awesome blog post by Nikki Gilland (also see her more recent update here).
This is pretty important since if you&amp;rsquo;ve used a curler you will know that the wrong sized eyelash curler can pinch your eyes.</description>
