      <description>These are both super skinny retractable pencil liners. The Clio one is a bit skinnier than the Dose of Colors one but they are both tiny. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with the use case of these things. You&amp;rsquo;re on the way to work or some important date or social event, and you didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to apply liner at home before you left. Because sleep is important, dammit.
For this use case, this type of liner is perfect.</description>

      <title>How to choose an eyelash curler which works for your eye shape and doesn&#39;t pinch your eyelid</title>

      <description>There is a very cool post on Reddit which talks about how you can measure the dimensions of eyelash curlers and your eye to ensure they match up. It&amp;rsquo;s based on this nerdy and awesome blog post by Nikki Gilland (also see her more recent update here).
This is pretty important since if you&amp;rsquo;ve used a curler you will know that the wrong sized eyelash curler can pinch your eyes.</description>

      <title>Morphe x Pony 35I Icy Fantasy Palette is cute but not for everyone</title>

      <description>I have never purchased a Morphe product before this palette because I always found the shade duplication off putting. It looks like they are moving away from that type of palette, since they are discontinuing a bunch of the palettes which are basically 35 shades of brown.
I have also never bought a Pony collaboration because none of them have really been that interesting.
The concept for this Icy Fantasy Palette is awesome though.</description>

      <title>OMG I love  Ashley Kaltwasser and Adam Bonilla</title>

      <description>I found about Ashley because of her side hustle(main hustle?) as a fitness model, not so much because of her IFBB bikini pro bodybuilding and Olympia accolades. Since I watch allll the glute workout videos, I watched her glute videos, and I thought she had an awesome attitude. She is so bubbly and motivated and fun. Her coach, Adam Bonilla, is super smart, sensible, and low stress.
They started this “Bikini and the Brain” podcast together towards the end of last year where they talk about their experiences with pro bikini bodybuilding competitions and address common questions and misconceptions.</description>

      <description>I am not gonna put any qualifiers or disclaimers here. Bad advice is bad advice, even if there is far worse out there.
I am also not going to do a deep dive and watch 50 videos from this guy to give some thorough, comprehensive review. I have seen enough.
I watched his “Is Workout Volume Actually Killing Your Gains? (Athlean-X Response)” video which came up in my youtube recommendations, probably because I am a fan of Athlean-X.</description>

      <title>The problem with Lip Tints: Review of Peripera Airy Ink Velvet Lip Tint</title>
      <link>https://lucy778.github.io/post/review-of-peripera-air-tint/</link>

      <description>What is Peripera Ink Airy Velvet Lip Tint? It&amp;rsquo;s basically a moussey lipstick which stains your lips. You can wear it like a liquid lipstick or remove it and just leave the tint.
How does it look? See the pics :)
Shade: #3 Sold Out Red. This is a cool red with a matte appearance. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t emphasise lip lines, it is super smoothing.
How does it wear? The Tint is long lasting but the liquid lipstick is not and has a tendency to smear and transfer.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Lucy and I have started this blog because basically, I spend a lot of time and money on make up and I want to channel my obssession into something more productive than just browsing instagram, youtube and reddit.
I want to share my thoughts on my favourite and not so favourite make up and beauty trends.
I know I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the blogging hype train by oh, about 10 years or so, but this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve never personally done and I thought it would be fun.</description>

      <description>My name is Lucy. Here are 5 facts about me:
 Normal to dry skin Neutral to cool toned skin ~NC10 Home country Australia, the western world&amp;rsquo;s desert wasteland of make up Favourite make up category is lipstick Can&amp;rsquo;t live without sunscreen  Why makeup? I think most of us who love makeup have similar reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s a creative outlet. It&amp;rsquo;s relaxing and therapeutic, full of soothing scents and soft brushes.</description>
