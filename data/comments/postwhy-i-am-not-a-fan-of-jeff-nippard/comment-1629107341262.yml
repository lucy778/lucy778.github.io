comment: "I've bought Jeff Cavaliere's program and it isn't great. His videos are clickbait most of the time, he's been accused of fake weights by Greg Doucette himself and has also depicted horrible deadlift form. So picking on a couple of videos of Jeff Nippard who actually cares to conclude a video with all the explanation you need (unlike Cavaliere) is not great.\r\n\r\n+ Jeff Cavaliere eats sugar/unhealthy food once a year on his birthday. 1 slice of cake. that's Xtreme."
