  Jeff is one of the only fitness Youtubers who backs up his claims with
  scientific literature. He does not make claims; he tells you something that
  has been proven by multiple (peer reviewed!) studies and only then presents
  these as facts. He is quick to be skeptical of information with limited
  backing. In his video on good mornings, he strongly recommends lifters new to
  the movement to load extremely light, and otherwise recommends a rep range of
  6-12. How different is the exercise from a romanian deadlift? Many argue that
  even a conventional deadlift is extremely dangerous. He pushes the good
  morning as an alternative to the rdl, except one with "better strength
  carryover to the squat". He may not include any serious disclaimers but he is
  presenting good technique. Does a food blogger need to include disclaimers on
  a new recipe she puts out? "WARNING: If Bleach and Ammonia is substituted for
  all other ingredients in these triple-chocolate fudge cakes, Mustard Gas will
  be produced instead of said cakes" If somebody chooses to use improper
  technique then that is not Jeff's fault. All weightlifting is dangerous. Your
  argument revolves mainly around citing Greg Doucette (known juicer who talks
  out his ass, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxRgYN9fDbc&t=22s where he
  deliberately misinterprets the TITLE of an article) and AthleanX, (proven
  liar, uses fake weights) and multiple ad hominem attacks.
